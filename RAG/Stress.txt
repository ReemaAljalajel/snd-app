Title: Stress
​​
stress definition:
Stress can be defined as a state of worry or mental tension caused by a difficult situation. Stress is a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our lives. Everyone experiences stress to some degree. The way we respond to stress, however, makes a big difference to our overall well-being.

How stress affect us:
Stress affects both the mind and the body. A little bit of stress is good and can help us perform daily activities. Too much stress can cause physical and mental health problems. Learning how to cope with stress can help us feel less overwhelmed and support our mental and physical well-being.

Symptoms of stress:
Academic stress can make it difficult to relax, often leading to anxiety, irritability, and difficulty focusing on studies. This can impact exam performance, assignments, and overall productivity. Physically, stress may cause headaches, muscle tension, stomach issues, or trouble sleeping, making it even harder to stay on top of coursework.

Possible causes of stress:
Stress affects people differently. Moreover, the causes of stress vary from a person to another, and the level of stress that you feel comfortable with may be higher or lower for others around you. Tense feelings usually occur when we feel that we do not have the resources to manage the challenges we face. Stress at work, school, home, illness, or difficult or sudden life events can lead to stress. Some possible causes include:
• Individual genetics, upbringing, and experience.
• Personal life and relationship difficulties.
• Major or unexpected life changes (e.g. moving out, having a baby, starting to look after someone).
• Financial difficulties (e.g. debt, or struggles to afford daily necessities).
• Difficult or unstable work environment.
• A feeling of loneliness and lack of support. 
• Loss in all its forms, whether a loved one, a job, etc.


How to manage and deal with stress?
• Eliminate stress triggers: University life can be overwhelming, but identifying and addressing stressors can help. If academic pressure feels too much, try adjusting your workload and prioritizing tasks. Delegating responsibilities in group projects, setting realistic expectations, and avoiding perfectionism can also reduce stress.
• Social support: Having a strong support system can help students cope with academic stress more effectively. Connecting with friends, family, or classmates who understand your challenges can provide emotional relief and encouragement.
• Maintaining quiet sleep: Academic stress can disrupt sleep. To improve sleep quality, stick to a routine, avoid screens before bed, and create a relaxing environment. Using SND’s background sounds can help you unwind and sleep better.
